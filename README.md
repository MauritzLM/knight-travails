# knight-travails

This project was really challenging but I enjoyed it a lot. I had to learn about graphs and how represent them, then using depth first search or breadth first search to traverse them.

I'm still looking to make some improvements eg. checking that the entered start and end sqaure are both valid. I think there is also room to improve the way I implemented the gameboard.
